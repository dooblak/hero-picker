Assault, sometimes referred to as Two Capture Point (2CP) , is a Game Mode in which the attacking and defending teams must attempt to take or defend capture points across the map. Defenders always have the same spawnpoint, whether defending the first or second point, while the attacker's spawn changes depending on the point they are attempting to capture. It should be noted that every Assault map has an almost-immediate choke point, and that the defenders' spawn is just behind the second point, making the second push just as difficult as breaking the choke.
