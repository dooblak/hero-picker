Maintained by Overwatch, the ecopoint served as a monitoring station for the study of Earth's changing climate.

Disaster struck the station when it was hit by a polar storm, damaging the station's solar array. Cut off from the outside world, the scientists were left stranded in the damaged facility. As their supplies dwindled, they entered cryostasis in a last-ditch effort to survive until a rescue attempt could be made.

Rescue came years later, but Dr. Mei-Ling Zhou was the only survivor. By this point, Overwatch was no more, and the eco-watchpoints had ceased to operate.
