The town was the site of one of the most famous 
battles during the Omnic Crisis. It was here that 
the leader of the Crusaders, Balderich von Adler, 
and a handful of his best soldiers, including his pupil, 
Reinhardt Wilhelm, made a last stand against an advancing automaton army.
Since Eichenwalde was in the way of a larger omnic advance to Stuttgart, 
the town was evacuated on October 11, from 3 to 8 o'clock. Outnumbered and outgunned, 
almost all Crusaders were slain during the resulting combat, including the 
organizations leader. However, thanks to their valiant efforts, 
the German military was able to push back the omnic offensive and 
win the fight. In the present day, Eichenwalde lies abandoned, and 
the forest has slowly begun overtaking the village. However, the scars of war will never completely fade.
