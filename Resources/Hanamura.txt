Hanamura is an Assault map in Overwatch.
Hanamura is a well-preserved village of unassuming shops and quiet streets, 
known mostly for its idyllic cherry blossom festival every spring. 
But to those who know its history, Hanamura is the ancestral home of the Shimada ninja clan, 
which had grown over the centuries to become a powerful criminal organization. 
As its neighboring cities expanded, Hanamura was encircled, and eventually it was 
incorporated as a district within a larger city. For now, the imposing compound of 
the Shimada family lies empty, but that peace may soon be broken.
