Ilios is located in the Aegean sea of Greece, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea.

Situated atop a small island rising from the Aegean Sea, Ilios is a postcard-perfect Mediterranean town, with a bustling harborside, winding paths for rambling hillside strolls, and gorgeous vistas. It is the ideal vacation stop for people looking for a place to relax, or for those interested in exploring the ruins scattered at the top of the island, where many artifacts and relics of the ancient world have been recently unearthed. The ruins were declared an internationally protected heritage site. However, Talon attempted to steal the artifacts.
