Russia was one of the countries hit hardest by the Omnic Crisis, 
but during the rebuilding process, it rode the wave of the mechanized 
labor industry's revitalization and entered a period of rapid growth.

Russia has returned to war footing, guarding its sparkling cities with 
the massive, human-piloted Svyatogor mechs developed and produced by Volskaya Industries.
