Junkertown is an Escort map located in the harsh and unforgiving Australian Outback. 
Constructed from the remains of a destroyed omnium, it's now the home to a band of 
lawless scavengers known as the Junkers, led by their cutthroat Queen. When they aren’t 
pillaging the omnium's skeleton for anything of value, the Junkers blow off steam in 
the Scrapyard—a massive gladiatorial arena whose combatants fight for glory, riches...and to survive.
