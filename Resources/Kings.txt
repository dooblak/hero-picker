King's Row is an upscale, cosmopolitan neighborhood of London, but just beneath its peaceful surface, tensions between omnics and humans are running high. While much of modern England was built on the backs of omnic laborers, they have been denied the basic rights that humans have, with most omnics forced to live in the dense, claustrophobic city-beneath-the-city known by some as "the Underworld." Of greater concern is that recent demonstrations by pro-omnic-rights protestors have resulted in violent clashes with the police, and a solution is nowhere in sight.
