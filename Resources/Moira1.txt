Moira’s biotic abilities enable her to contribute healing or damage 
in any crisis. While Biotic Grasp gives Moira short-range options, 
her Biotic Orbs contribute longer-range, hands-off damage and healing; 
she can also Fade to escape groups or remain close to allies in need 
of support. Once she’s charged Coalescence, Moira can save multiple allies 
from elimination at once or finish off weakened enemies.
