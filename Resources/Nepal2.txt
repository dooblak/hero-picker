Years ago, a group of omnic robots experienced what they described as a spiritual awakening. They abandoned their programmed lives to establish a monastery high in the Himalayas, where like-minded omnics could gather to meditate on the nature of their existence. Led by their spiritual leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, they took over the ruins of an ancient monastery and turned it into the home of the Shambali, a place where omnics and humans alike make pilgrimages in the hopes of finding a greater truth.
