Orisa serves as the central anchor of her team, and defends her 
teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier. She can 
attack from long range, fortify her own defenses, launch graviton 
charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to 
boost the damage output of multiple allies at once.
