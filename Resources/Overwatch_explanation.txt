Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment.
It was released in May 2016 for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six,
 with each player selecting from a roster of over 20 characters, known in-game as "heroes", each with a unique
 style of play, whose roles are divided into four general categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. 
Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the
 map in a limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character
 skins and victory poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a 
competitive ranked mode, various 'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently 
included following its release. Additionally, Blizzard has developed and added new characters, maps, and 
game modes post-release, while stating that all Overwatch updates will remain free, with the only additional 
cost to players being microtransactions to earn additional cosmetic rewards
