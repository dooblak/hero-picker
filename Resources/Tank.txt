Tank heroes have high endurance and excel at protecting allies and disrupting enemies. 
The primary role of the tank is to absorb incoming enemy fire through active abilities 
and a generally high health pool. Secondary to this, soaking the right amount of 
sustainable damage can help team supports farm ultimate charge before an engagement.
