Nestled among the ancient ruins of the Giza Plateau on the outskirts of Cairo, 
the Temple of Anubis is one of many new excavations in the area. 
While most believe that the site is of interest for archaelogical reasons, 
it also hides the entrance to a research facility that extends deep beneath the earth. 
The facility is alleged to house an artificial intelligence, but the whole truth is known 
only to a select few. Not even the agents of Helix Security International who guard the 
facility know what they're protecting.
