At its height, Overwatch maintained a number of bases around the world, 
each with its own purpose: peacekeeping, scientific research, or in the 
case of Watchpoint: Gibraltar, providing an orbital launch facility. 
The base was mothballed along with the rest of Overwatch's installations, 
but there have been recent reports of activity within the perimeter. 
Could this indicate the presence of former Overwatch agents, or is this 
the work of organizations with more nefarious intentions?
